# Examples

Put examples of source files that your grammar targets in this directory.  

The idea is to have some representative examples of code that will show how your grammar handles real code. 
If you have bugs/issues raised against your grammar, if your users supply example code, and the license permits, you may want to include them here. 

For examples of what kind of thing to put here, see:
